### Hellow GitHub! ðŸ˜„

My name is <b>Ruby Kozel</b>, I'm currently 26 years old and live in Israel.
I have a B.Sc at <b>Software Engineering</b> and am working as a <b>Full-Stack Cloud Developer @ SAP Cloud Portal Team</b> for the past 2 years.

As a Full-Stack developer I have the opertunity to write secure cloud applications and programs that reaches thousands of people.  
My expertise and favorite would be writing <b>Node.js</b> applications and microservices with various frameworks such as <b>Express</b> for JavaScript and <b>NestJS</b> for Typescript.  
In the front-end side I focuse on professioning <b>React</b> as my main JS framework, but I'm also learning other frameworks such as <b>Svelt</b> and <b>Vue</b>.   
For databases I mainly use non-relational databases such as MongoDB or Firebase Firestore, but I'm also familiar with PostgreSQL and ORM in JS and TS.  
   
I'm also familiar with
* writing native mobile applications using <b>React Native</b> and have developed a native application with is as my final project.
* Java development, including the <b>Spring</b> framework for REST APIs
* Python development, including knowledge in <b>Flask</b>, <b>Connexion</b> and <b>PyTorch</b>, 

Coding is a hobby for me and I enjoy building and creating new application and programs to pass the time and solve my own individual problems, and hopefully - others too.    

I always track the latest and greatest feature in cloud and web development and try to stay updated with all the hot topics. ðŸ”­

I'm doing my best to donate to the open-source community as much as I can and am looking to collaborate at some interesting full-stack applications ðŸ‘¯
